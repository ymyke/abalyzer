# Niftylytics -- NFT Collection Analytics

A collection of Jupyter notebooks and supporting code to analyze NFT collections (as
opposed to indiviual NFTs such as individual crypto art pieces), focussing in particular
on the traits of the NFTs and their relationship to their price.

## Table of contents:

* Art Blocks projects:
  * [Meridians](https://nbviewer.org/github/ymyke/niftylytics/blob/main/meridians.ipynb)
  * [Fidenzas](https://nbviewer.org/github/ymyke/niftylytics/blob/main/fidenzas.ipynb)
  * [Rorschachs](https://nbviewer.org/github/ymyke/niftylytics/blob/main/rorschachs.ipynb)

* Other collections:
